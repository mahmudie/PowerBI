# World Life Expectancy Dashboard

Please refer to the definition and data source of the world life expectancy [here](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy)

Following are some insights I was able to make from this dashboard:

* The average life expectancy has improved globally from 63 years in 1980 to 74 years in 2019.
* Europe had the highest average life expectancy of 74, while Africa had the lowest life expectancy of 55 years.
* In 1980, five countries ( Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Niger, South Sudan, Mali) had reported a life expectancy of under 40 years.
* No country had ever reported a life expectancy of 80 years or more in 1980, compared to 24% of countries in 2019.
